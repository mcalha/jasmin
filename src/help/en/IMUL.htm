    <strong>Command:</strong> IMUL- Signed integer multiplication<br>
    <strong>Arguments:</strong> DEST and SRC: register , IMMED: immediate (if all three are given IMMED must be 8bit)<br>
    <strong>Usage:</strong> IMUL [DEST,] SRC [,IMMED]<br>
    <strong>Effects:</strong> Signed multiplication of register (or possibly of dest) by src (and possibly an immediate factor).<br>
    <strong>Flags&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;set:</strong> CF and OF
    <br><strong>Misc:</strong> Operands in brackets are optional. If SRC is 8bit it's multiplied by AL and the result stored in AX. If src is 16bit, AX is multiplied and the result is stored in DX:AX. If SRC is 32bit, EAX is multiplied an the result is stored in EDX:EAX.
