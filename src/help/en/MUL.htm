    <strong>Command:</strong> MUL (Unsigned Multiplication of AL, AX or EAX)<br>

    <strong>Usage:</strong> MUL DEST<br>

    <strong>Arguments:</strong> DEST: Any 8, 16 or 32 bit memory location or register<br>

    <strong>Effects:</strong> MUL performs unsigned multiplication.<br>
    A byte operand is multiplied by AL; the result is left in AX. The carry and overflow flags are set to 0 if AH is 0; otherwise, they are set to 1.<br>
    A word operand is multiplied by AX; the result is left in DX:AX. DX contains the high-order 16 bits of the product. The carry and overflow flags are set to 0 if DX is 0; otherwise, they are set to 1.<br>
    A doubleword operand is multiplied by EAX; the result is left in EDX:EAX. EDX contains the high-order 32 bits of the product. The carry and overflow flags are set to 0 if EDX is 0; otherwise, they are set to 1.
    <br>

    <strong>Flags to be set:</strong> OF and CF as described; SF, ZF, AF, PF, and CF are undefined<br>
