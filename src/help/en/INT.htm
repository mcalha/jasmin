<div style="font-family:Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:11px;">
    <strong>Command:</strong> Sends a software interrupt<br>
    <strong>Arguments:</strong> TYPE: An immediate number from 0-255 defining the type of interrupt<br>
    <strong>Usage:</strong> INT TYPE<br>
    <strong>Effects:</strong> INT sends an interrupt.

    Interrupts are usually handled by the Operating System.

    Currently Jasmin implements a small part of the DOS-Interrupt 0x21, which may be used to interactively read a string
    supplied by the user into memory. AH has to be set to 0x0A and a memory location must be provided in DX. The first byte there
    must be set to determine the maximum buffer length. The next byte will be set by the interrupt handler, indicating how many bytes have been read.
    After that a string of bytes of that length follows. Finally it is terminated by a NULL-string.
